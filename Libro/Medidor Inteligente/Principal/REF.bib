 abstract = {Strong and smart is the essential requirement of the development of modern power grid and the twenty-first Century energy development driving force. Smart grid bearing in response to changing in the environment, improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions is an important mission. Smart grid has become the new development trend and new directions of the world power grid. The effective coordination of demands interest group of Smart Grid, promote the orderly development of smart grid. The main purpose is to realize Smart Grid interoperability and to guarantee open framework of Smart Grid. The IEC (International Electrical Commission), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and SGCC (STATE GRID Corporation of China) issued technology standards roadmap of Smart Grid. From technology view of Smart Grid, the IEC include 13 domains. From view of interest group of Smart Grid, according to the United States market conditions, the NIST covers 7 domains. The SGCC covers 8 domains, according to Chinese power industry conditions. The future five years and fifteen years of IEC, NIST and SGCC smart grid technology standard trend focuses are given, in the way of the mathematical model of probability distribution, according to the technology standard requirements of maturity of the Smart Grid related fields of technology, products and market. It is likelihood the middle and long-term development focuses of future Smart Grid technical standards that two-way interactive service of power consumption, distribution management, electric storage, renewable energy generation. It is suggested that the Smart Grid technology advantage into standard advantage, in the promotion of Smart Grid equipment R {\&} D and manufacturing level and promote the overall construction of Smart Grid at the same time, to strengthen our country voice in the Smart Grid international standards, to seize commanding heights of technical innovation and industrial development.},

 abstract = {A smart-metering system is a system that meters electricity, gas, and water consumption and manages their supply by controlling measuring devices remotely. Power-line communication (PLC) does not require a separate communication line and can be easily installed by utilizing power-line infrastructure. PLC also allows users to easily connect measuring devices to the PLC network by plugging the power cord into an electrical outlet. Therefore, a smart-metering system over PLC has been considered as one of the most appropriate technologies for meter reading and automatic control, which are essential in realization of a smart grid. We propose a secure smart-metering protocol including: 1) key materials generation and provisioning to devices without exposure; 2) initialization to authenticate devices in the network and share keys between devices before exchanging data, (3) secure transmission of meter-reading data, and 4) revocation management to handle discarded devices from the network. Especially, our protocol provides strong authentication of devices and data: It prevents a single point of failure by adopting secret sharing through multiple certificate authorities. It also reduces the risk of denial-of-service attacks on the server by hop-by-hop authentication for data transmitted from terminal nodes to the server.},
